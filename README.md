# 100_JS_Projects
Boost your JavaScript skills!

My projects are based on the [100+ JavaScript Projects for Beginners](https://jsbeginners.com/javascript-projects-for-beginners/) that lists over 100 JavaScript projects for beginners. There are no frameworks and each completed project includes the description, a summary, and the source files to download. 

This is also great when you join [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge to code for 100 days.

Happy coding!üòä‚ù§Ô∏è
