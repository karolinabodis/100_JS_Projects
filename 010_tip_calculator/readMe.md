# Project_Tip_Calculator

A JavaScript Project where the calculator evaluates the tip that each person may have to pay based on the service experience.

_Goals:_

✔️ A feedback should be alerted if a user forgets to add input or the input is blank (or less than zero), which fades away after 5 seconds.

✔️ An animation should show up for a couple of seconds before the results of calculation.

✔️ The calculator should reset all form inputs after 10 seconds.

✔️ Extra error handling: during the calculation hide the Calculate button and disable the input fields
